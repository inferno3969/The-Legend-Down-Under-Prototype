# The-Legend-Down-Under-Prototype
The Legend Down Under Prototype game made in Unity for my Software Engineering and Application Development class at South Hills School of Business and Technology. 

This prototype was mostly built with the guidance of Mister Taft Creates' YouTube video tutorial series, "Make a game like the Legend of Zelda using Unity and C#".
